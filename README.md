# Mini E-commerce Flutter App

A comprehensive Flutter e-commerce application built with Firebase backend, featuring user authentication, product catalog, shopping cart, order management, payment processing, and location services.

## üöÄ Features

### Core E-commerce Features

- **User Authentication**: Email/password and Google Sign-In
- **Product Catalog**: Browse products with search and filtering
- **Shopping Cart**: Add/remove items with quantity management
- **Order Management**: Track order status and history
- **Payment Processing**: Stripe integration for secure payments
- **Profile Management**: User profile with photo upload and cropping

### Additional Features

- **Location Services**: Google Maps integration with current location
- **Push Notifications**: Firebase messaging for order updates
- **Image Handling**: Profile photo with crop functionality
- **Responsive Design**: Material Design 3 with modern UI/UX
- **State Management**: Provider pattern for efficient state handling
- **Feature Toggle System**: Easy enable/disable of optional features

### Configuration System

The app includes a simple configuration system in `lib/config/app_config.dart` that allows you to easily enable/disable features:

```dart
class AppConfig {
  static const bool enableGoogleMaps = false; // Set to true when Maps API key is configured
  static const bool enableFirebaseStorage = false; // Set to true when Storage is enabled
  static const bool enableImageCropper = true; // Set to true when image cropping is needed
}
```

**To enable features:**

1. Set the corresponding flag to `true` in `app_config.dart`
2. Configure the required services (Maps API, Firebase Storage, etc.)
3. The app will automatically use the enabled features

**Current Status:**

- ‚úÖ **Core E-commerce**: Fully functional
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Google Maps**: Disabled (requires API key)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Image Upload**: Disabled (requires Firebase Storage)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Image Cropping**: Disabled (can be enabled independently)
